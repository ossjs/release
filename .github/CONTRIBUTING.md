# Contributing Guidelines

## No-issue Policy

_Open-source tools with issues disabled? That's laughable_. Perhaps. But that's the only way I see this project sustainable. I'm currently maintaining more than a dozen of open-source libraries, and I don't feel like adding another dozen on top would make my life easier. If you're planning on using these packages, I can assume you're an open-source maintainer yourself. I also expect that this paragraph (and the stance behind it) is self-explanatory to any open-source maintainer.

This being said, the OSSJS initiative is not closed to contributions. It's only closed to spamming the counter of issues nobody's going to look at after opening.

### How can I contribute then?

- **Open a discussion**. When in doubt, always open a discussion in the respective repository. A day of discussion saves a month of work. Let's discuss your ideas and suggestions before spending any time working on those.
- **Open a pull request**. This is a great place to start if you've spotted an issue. You don't have to know how to fix that immediately but you can always commit a reproduction test suite.
